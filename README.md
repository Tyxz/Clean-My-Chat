# Clean My Chat
A small addon for Elder Scrolls Online (no affiliation), to reduce messages in unknown languages from the chat window.

It filters each message if it contains forbidden characters like French ("é", "à"), German (ä, ö, ü) or cyrillic (б", "г", "ж", etc.).

You are also able to define your own filtered words or characters. For example, 
it could be also used to filter swear words not detected by ESO itself. 
## Settings
If you have the LibAddonMenu-2.0 installed, you will have access to the settings menu to define your own filters 
and set or unset the filter for predefined characters.
